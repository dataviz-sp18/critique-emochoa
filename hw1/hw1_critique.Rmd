# Part 1: Critique


Consider a visualization of "The Office Characters' Most Distinguishing Words", found at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8a4gbr/the_office_characters_most_distinguishing_words_oc/) and attributed to [/u/RyBread7](https://www.reddit.com/user/RyBread7)):

## Truthful?

The visualization does not cite a source for the text that was analyzed; given the uncontroversial nature of the subject material, however, I have no reason to doubt that the analyses were conducted with scripts of the show.

## Functional?
 

## Beautiful?


## Insightful?


## Enlightening?












## Text of the assignment

Select a data visualization and write a (roughly) 1000 word critique of the visualization based on the five qualities of great visualizations:[1]

Is it truthful?
Is it functional?
Is it beautiful?
Is it insightful?
Is it enlightening?
Remember that to critique something does not mean to tear it down or find all the flaws. Critiques should include both positive and negative aspects - what did the author do well? What are the weaknesses of the visualization? How could the truthfulness of the visualization be improved?

Finding a visualization
Some good resources for finding visualizations to critique:

Academic journals/books in your field which include graphs or charts (you don't have to find some super-duper high tech interactive graph on the web)
r/dataisbeautiful
Nathan Yau's Flowing Data blog
FiveThirtyEight or The Upshot - or really any other data journalism site

## Submission details

Be sure to include a link to the original visualization in your critique. Submit your critique as a Markdown formatted document that can be read directly in the repo on GitHub. Write either in the original .md file or write it as an R Markdown document rendered using the github_output format.
